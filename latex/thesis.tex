\begin{abstract}
During the last centuries human research on the interaction of species substantially intensified. However, we know little to nothing about the underlying process that shape the behaviours of alien species invasion across regions, countries and ecosystems. The invasion of species can be understood in terms of actions, or events, which can be properly described as a set of discrete events in which one individual, in our case a species, emits a directed interaction with another, the region or area of invasion. Under this framework, we can describe the invasion of species in time as a temporal bipartite species-region graph. We then present a relation event model (REM) to model the study of co-invasion of species. We then apply this model to a dataset of (TODO size of dataset) ranging from (TODO years dataset). The aim of this paper is hence to study what group of species have the tendency to co-invade a region.

The increase of the rate on which alien species invade countries has increased over the last century and it's becoming an issue. The economic impact of alien species in Europe is estimated to be close to 13 billion dollars annually \citet{intro:rate}. The interest of the study of the dynamics of invasion species has been increasing in the years for this reason. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the problem, is hard to come up with real actions. Intuitively, the invasion rate of species differs belong taxonomic groups, however, a comprehensive global invasion dynamics study of the last centuries subdivided by taxonomic groups is still lacking. \citet{intro:dataset} first tackled the problems by generating a large dataset of invasive species in multiple geographic regions worldwide. To further extend this study \citet{intro:ecological} fitted a REM on the dataset.

%TODO I can't find the "Analysing ecological dynamics with relational event
models: the case of invasion events" paper


%TODO it would be nice to include some plots of the dataset.

\section{The second, math section}

\textbf{Theorem 1 (Residue Theorem).}
Let $f$ be analytic in the region $G$ except for the isolated singularities $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_m$. If $\gamma$ is a closed rectifiable curve in $G$ which does not pass through any of the points $a_k$ and if $\gamma\approx 0$ in $G$ then
\[
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma f = \sum_{k=1}^m n(\gamma;a_k) \text{Res}(f;a_k).
\]
\textbf{Theorem 2 (Maximum Modulus).}
\emph{Let $G$ be a bounded open set in $\mathbb{C}$ and suppose that $f$ is a continuous function on $G^-$ which is analytic in $G$. Then}
\[
\max\{|f(z)|:z\in G^-\}=\max \{|f(z)|:z\in \partial G \}.
\]
