# Master Thesis: Invasive species modelling via relational event models

Dynamic processes play a key role in ecology for the survival or extinction of species, and the structure
of communities. Among these dynamics, there is a kaleidoscope of possible species interactions, from
mutual benefit to mutual harm. Whereas some of these interactions are effectively constant, there are
interactions, where timing and time-ordering is particularly important. Studying such interaction
systems is challenging. By focusing on individual species, it may be possible to identify individual drivers
and factors but ignores interactions between species. Studying larger systems has often relied on
differential equation modelling, that is not amenable to the inclusion of covariates. In this project we
use a relational event model for studying the drivers of temporal ecological dynamics. Temporal
interaction dynamics encode sequences of relational events connecting a sender to a recipient at a
specific point in time. Relational event models provide a concise way to analyse a broad family of
interactional patterns and their underlying drivers.
